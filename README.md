🎨 Creative Coding Playground with Processing (2018-2019) 🚀

Explore a collection of visually captivating projects and little games that I crafted between 2018 and 2019 in my free time using the Processing language. From mesmerizing animations to interactive visualizations, this repository showcases my journey into the world of creative coding.

At that time, I was on the very beginning of my programming journey, and essentially these are among the first over-100-lines-of-code programs I've ever written. Accordingly, the code is rather unprofessional, repetitive, and mainly uncommented. However, it gets the job done most of the time.

🔧 Getting Started:

Clone the repository.
Open the projects in Processing. Processing can be downloaded at [Processing](https://processing.org/).
Dive into the code and tweak according to your preferences and creativity!
