# Projects-in-Processing
This repository contains some of the simple visual projects I created in my free time during 2018-2019 using Processing.

At that time, I was on the very beginning of my programming journey, and essentially these are among the first over-100-lines-of-code programs I've ever written. Accordingly, the code is rather unprofessional, repetitive, and mainly uncommented. However, it gets the job done most of the time.

## Running the projects

To run the projects, download [Processing](https://processing.org/) on your machine, download and open the files, and click on the run button.
